This page is used to quickly view the energy spectrum of a channel. The user selects the number of bins of the spectrum, which represents how many points we can didide 0-65536 into. Select to view the channel and then press the *Draw* button.

The *Open Fit* button in the upper left corner is used for fast Gaussian fitting to see energy resolution. Click the button to turn on the fitting mode, and click the button again to turn it off. Move the mouse to the blue line of the histogram and the mouse cross will become a triangular arrow. The mouse of the triangle arrow clicks on two positions in the histogram, and the interval between the two points is the fitting interval, then the energy resolution can be viewed.
