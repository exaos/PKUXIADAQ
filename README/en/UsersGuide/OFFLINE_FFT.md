# FFT

![FFT](/img/FFT.png)

This interface is used to quickly view the Fourier transform of the waveform. Users can choose different algorithms, such as **XIA, fftw3, CAEN(HANNING), CAEN(HAMMING), CAEN(BLACKMAN), CAEN(RECT)**. Select the channel you want to view. Then press the *Draw* button, and each time the button is clicked, the next result is displayed.



the ADC trace display also includes the option to view a FFT of the acquired trace. This is useful to diagnose noise contributions.
