# Time Diff

![Time Diff](/img/TimeDiff.png)

This interface is used to quickly view the time resolution of the two signals. The user can choose to view the time difference between the two signals of the zero crossing of the CFD algorithm or the time difference between two signals of the fast filter over threshold. **Xbin** represents the bin number of the abscissa, **Xmin** represents the minimum value of the abscissa, and **Xmax** represents the maximum value of the abscissa. With Ch A, Ch B we can select the two channels we want to view. Then press the *Draw* button.


The option **Limits** selection turns on the energy range constraint. After selecting this option, the following four parameters, AL, AR, BL, and BR, take effect, which respectively represent the left and right ranges of the Ch A/B energy address, and only events with energy falling in this interval are filled into the histogram. The **Orig Energy** page allows the user to select the appropriate energy channel interval.
