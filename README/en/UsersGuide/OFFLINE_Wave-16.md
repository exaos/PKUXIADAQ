# Wave-16

![Waveform16](/img/Waveform16.png)

This page is used to view 16 channels of raw waveforms, filter waveforms, thresholds, and so on. Users can choose to display multiple waveforms in **Wave/Slow Filter/Fast filter/Thres/CFD/CFD Thres** simultaneously.


Through this page, the user can quickly check whether the waveforms of all channels of the module are normal and whether the parameter settings are reasonable. Click the button **Draw** once to display the next waveform for all channels.


*It should be noted that when the acquired waveform pre-trigger trace length is greater than 3 x EFRT + EFFT, the Slow Filter waveform on this page is correct.*
