## About

**This manual applies only to XIA LLC Pixie-16**

- This program is developed by the **group of experimental nuclear physics of Peking University**.  
- The earliest graphical interface development of this program is based on NSCL DDAS Nscope(http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/newsite/ddas-1.1/nscope.html). 
- Thanks to Hui Tan's(XIA LLC) support for our development.


Technical adviser:
- Zhihuan Li  李智焕

- Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences(IMP)
- China Institute of Atomic Energy(CIAE)
- The University of Hong Kong(HKU)
- Shandong University, Weihai(SDU)

----

This program is applicable to XIA Pixie16 module, supports 100/250/500 MHz(specifically, the model can be found in File->About in the graphics software), and supports up to 8 chassis synchronous operation, that is, 1600+ signals are simultaneously collected. **This package requires the CERN ROOT6. Requires a 1920x1080 and above resolution display**.



The program is designed to be compatible with the 100/250/500 MHz modules. Simply add the firmware location of the corresponding sample rate modules to cfgPixie16.txt. The program can automatically identify the modules type and load the corresponding firmware. Currently we only have a 100/250 MHz 14 bit modules, so this type of modules can be run by default. To support other types, please contact XIA LLC to obtain the corresponding firmware or contact Hongyi Wu(wuhongyi@qq.com).

## Update

- The main control interface developed based on the ROOT GUI is highly complex and difficult for users to modify now. Users do not easy to develop their own version based on this program. 
- We are also developing a web control for online/offline analysis:
	- ZeroMQ
	- FastCGI
	- JSROOT
	- web
	- ...
